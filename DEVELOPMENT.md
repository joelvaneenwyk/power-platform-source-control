# Development

## Preparation

- install python 3+
- set up venv for this folder `py -m venv env`
- use the env `.\env\Scripts\activate`
- update pip `.\env\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- get dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - ignore warning about mq install
- get pyinstaller `pip install pyinstaller`

## Package

`pyinstaller --onefile -w .\pbivcs.py`

this will bundle up `pbivcs.exe` to \dist
Note - this kicks off some antivirus programs - you may need to unquarantine it.
